Vector DB with LLM interface to store and return personal info.

ChromaDB for vector db. 
Ollama + model for LLM. 

Python for scripting + poetry. 

Docker to contain everything? Need research done here.


Actual Product: 

Each user has an account: 
Their own multimodal vector db.
Can interact with a LLM chatbot to save and retrieve data. 
Can also search through “pages” which can be for events or people.
